# KubeCon 2025 London: kcp workshop

We wish to welcome you to KubeCon 2025 London, at kcp's workshop titled _Exploring Multi-Tenant Kubernetes APIs and Controllers with kcp!_

While Kubernetes transformed container orchestration, creating multi-tenant platforms remains a significant challenge. kcp goes beyond DevOps and workload management, to reimagine how we deliver true SaaS experiences for platform engineers. Think workspaces and multi-tenancy, not namespaces in a singular cluster. Think sharding and horizontal scaling, not overly large and hard to maintain deployments. With novel approaches to well-established building blocks in Kubernetes API-Machinery, this CNCF sandbox project gives engineers a framework to host and consume any kind of API they need to support their platforms.

In this hands-on workshop, you will learn how to extend Kubernetes with kcp, build APIs, and design controllers to tackle multi-tenancy challenges. By exploring real-world scenarios like DBaaS across clusters, you will gain practical skills to create scalable, multi-tenant platforms for their Kubernetes environments.

## Session outline

1. **Introduction.** Together we'll see what does SaaS mean in Kubernetes, and how kcp plays a key role in enabling platform engineers and developers to build such SaaS platforms.
2. **Exploration.** We’ll get familiar writing kcp-aware code.
3. **Demonstration.** We’ll walk through a practical example and guide you through the prepared exercises.
4. **Execution.** Together, we’ll put everything we’ve learnt into action and build a tiny DBaaS platform—right on your PC!

The examples will touch on hosting and consuming SaaS-like APIs we'll create during the session: self-servicing databases to be used in a web-app platform.

## Before we begin

Before we begin, we needed to make a few assumptions about your PC and its environment:
* Your PC is running recent **Linux with systemd** or **MacOS**, with **amd64** or **arm64** architecture.
* We are also expecting you have installed [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [podman](https://podman.io/), and [git](https://git-scm.com/); if not, please do it now.

All the tools and services we'll present during this workshop are local, don't require super-user privileges, and won't make permament changes to your system.

## Starting out

Once ready, start by heading over to the first warm-up exercise: `00-prerequisites`.
